 *
 * - Anthropic reads a trailing assistant message as response prefill. That is a

 *   native structured output (`responseFormat`) is in play, where Anthropic rejects it.
 * - Gemini 3 and later return 400 "Requests ending with a model turn are not
 *   supported" for any request, structured output or not, so the guard always
 *   intervenes for those models.
 *
 * In both cases a short user message is appended so the request ends on a user turn.
 * Provider and version gating for *attaching* the processor lives at the attach
 * sites; this class only decides when the appended turn is needed.

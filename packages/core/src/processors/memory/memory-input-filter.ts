/**
 * MemoryInputFilter — the input boundary between a client's request body and stored memory.
 *
 * ## What it is
 *
 * An input processor owned by memory. `Memory.getInputProcessors()` pushes it first, ahead of
 * MessageHistory, WorkingMemory, SemanticRecall, and Observational Memory, so it sees and can
 * rewrite the raw request input before any loader reads it.
 *
 * ## Why it exists
 *
 * Clients that use memory are told to send only the new message each turn (see the warning in
 * `docs/src/content/en/docs/memory/message-history.mdx` and the `prepareSendMessagesRequest`
 * example in `docs/src/content/en/integrations/agentic-ui/ai-sdk-ui.mdx`). Many don't. The
 * default `useChat` shape echoes the entire conversation back on every request, and that echo
 * is lossy: it is whatever the UI happened to have, not what was persisted.
 *
 * When memory treated that echo as the newest truth, three things went wrong:
 *
 *   1. The echoed copy was persisted over the stored row, so the client's `createdAt` rewrote
 *      the thread's ordering and the stored message lost its server-assigned identity.
 *   2. Assistant echoes carry text and tool calls but usually not the reasoning that produced
 *      them. Replaying text item ids without their reasoning item id makes OpenAI reject the
 *      request with "Item 'msg_*' of type 'message' was provided without its required
 *      'reasoning' item" (issue #24052).
 *   3. Whitespace differences between the stored text and the echoed text made the two copies
 *      look like distinct parts, so the model saw the assistant turn twice.
 *
 * Stripping provider metadata at send time only hid the symptom, and only for one provider path.
 * The fix is here: decide what the request is actually allowed to contribute before memory
 * loads. Memory is the base layer for a thread; the request may only add what memory doesn't
 * already have.
 *
 * ## What the request is allowed to contribute
 *
 * For a thread that already has stored messages, based on the tail of the input:
 *
 *   - ends with user message(s) → keep those, back to the last assistant message. Several
 *     consecutive user messages are all kept: they are all new, and they are stamped server-side
 *     (the normal client shape sends no ids, so ids and `createdAt` come from the server, and a
 *     client-supplied `createdAt` cannot reorder the thread). If that assistant message carries
 *     client tool updates (a result, error, denial, or approval answer), keep the ones that fill
 *     in a call its stored copy still has pending; see `advanceStoredToolCalls`.
 *   - ends with an assistant message → keep only its trailing run of client tool updates. This
 *     is the client-side tool flow: the assistant turn was stored with a pending call, and the
 *     client is returning the outcome for it. Everything earlier in that message is already
 *     stored. An update for a call the stored copy already finished is ignored when the two
 *     copies are layered in `MessageList.add`.
 *   - ends with an assistant message and no new results → drop it, but only if it exists in
 *     storage (see the `listMessagesById` check below). Internal callers such as the agent
 *     network pass assistant-role instruction messages that were never persisted; those are
 *     the whole prompt and must survive.
 *
 * For a thread with nothing stored, the entire input is the seed. Assistant provider metadata is
 * stripped there, because item ids name server-side items that this request never created — that
 * is exactly the orphaned-reference shape from #24052. Tool results keep their metadata: that
 * data came from the client.
 *
 * A caller that assembled the input itself can opt out of all of the above with
 * `retainFullInput`. The input is then processed exactly as supplied — no trim, no seed strip —
 * which is what the nested `useAgent` structuring pass needs so its replayed request keeps the
 * same message prefix as the parent run.
 *
 * ## What happens after this runs
 *
 * Loaders add stored rows as `memory`. `MessageList.add` treats a memory-sourced message that
 * collides by id with input as the base layer — the stored copy takes the slot with its
 * reasoning, provider metadata, and `createdAt`, the input's parts layer on top, and the merged
 * message stays tagged `input` so the client's contribution is still persisted. See the
 * base-layer branch in `packages/core/src/agent/message-list/message-list.ts`.

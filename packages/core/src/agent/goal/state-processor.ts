// Carries the agent's current objective on the agent state-signal lane
// (`stateId: 'goal'`) so the model always knows what it is working toward.
//
// Unlike the task list, the objective is small and changes infrequently, so this
// processor is snapshot-only: every emission is a full `<current-objective>`
// snapshot. It emits when the objective text or status changes, re-snapshots
// when observational memory drops the base from the window, and otherwise stays
// silent so the cached prefix is not invalidated. Progress fields (`runsUsed`,
// `maxRuns`) are deliberately not part of the projection: a snapshot is
// append-only, so it cannot keep a per-attempt counter current, and the goal
// judge reminder already reports the live attempt count.
//
// The objective itself lives in the thread-scoped `threadState` domain under
// `type: 'goal'`; this processor projects it onto the model context. State
// signals require a memory-backed thread; the runtime enforces this.

// Renders the inner body of the objective signal. The state-signal framework
// wraps (and XML-escapes) this string inside the signal's `tagName`
// (`current-objective`), so this returns only the body — wrapping it in the tag
// here would double-wrap the markup the model sees.

  // pass advances `runsUsed` every attempt, so keying on it would make the key
  // differ from the previous projection on every step and re-add an unchanged
  // objective to the window. The projection is append-only, so re-adding it
  // duplicates context rather than updating it. Whether the objective is
  // already in the window is what decides re-emission; the attempt count is

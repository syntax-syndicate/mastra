# Trace import architecture

Trace import is internal to the Mastra CLI. This directory defines the boundary
between source providers and the shared import pipeline.

## Provider responsibility

A provider reads its own API and yields `TraceImportRecord` values through the
`TraceImportProvider` contract. It owns:

- authentication and source project discovery;
- pagination and source rate-limit handling;
- reconstructing complete source trace trees;
- source-specific validation and skip reasons;
- mapping source fields into `TraceImportTrace`;
- creating stable destination trace and span IDs.

Provider-specific types and behavior stay inside that provider's directory.

## Shared importer responsibility

The shared importer receives only complete Mastra traces or explicit skip
records. It owns common validation, local preparation, whole-trace batching,
upload retries, resume, verification, reporting, and cleanup.

The shared importer must not import provider-specific types. Adding another
provider should require a new adapter, not another upload pipeline.

## Local preparation and resume

Preparation is an upload-free pass over the provider output. It writes two
private files under `~/.mastra/imports/traces/<target-project>/<import-id>/`:

- `manifest.json` stores source identity, the fixed import window, counts, and
  acknowledged progress.
- `traces.jsonl` stores one complete normalized trace per line.

Upload batches are created in memory from whole JSONL records, so a trace is
never split across requests. After Platform acknowledges a batch, the manifest
advances by that batch's trace count. Resume skips those acknowledged records
and starts at the first pending trace. A batch whose response was lost may be
sent again; provider adapters therefore generate stable destination IDs.

Partial preparation is discarded and downloaded again. The implementation does
not keep source pages, shards, batch files, checksums, or fsync bookkeeping.
Prepared trace data is removed only after upload and read-back verification
succeed.

## Platform upload

The shared upload loop sends each in-memory whole-trace batch to a
`TraceImportTarget`. The Mastra Platform target posts the exact prepared
`{"spans": [...]}` payload to the project-scoped collector route and requires a
successful acknowledgement with the expected span count before advancing the
manifest checkpoint.

Temporary network and collector failures are retried with bounded backoff. If a
response is lost after the collector accepted it, the batch remains pending and
is safely replayed with the same stable IDs. Authentication, quota, payload, and
other permanent errors are returned immediately without changing progress.
Consecutive batches are paced to approximately 100 spans per second by default;
an individual trace remains whole even when it contains more than 100 spans.

## Read-back verification and reports

After every prepared trace is acknowledged, the shared verifier selects a
deterministic sample of at most ten traces. It uses Platform's lightweight
trace endpoint to compare span IDs, parent links, names, span types, event
flags, timestamps, and error presence. It does not download or compare customer
input, output, attributes, metadata, or tags.

Verification retries briefly for query propagation. A mismatch, timeout, or
unavailable query API pauses the import, writes `report.json`, and keeps
`traces.jsonl` so verification can be retried without uploading acknowledged
traces again. Successful verification marks the import complete, writes the
report, and removes the prepared trace file.

The customer-facing command is implemented by a later ticket.

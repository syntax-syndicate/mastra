# @mastra/connect

`@mastra/connect` exposes tools backed by connections attached to a Mastra Platform project. Provider credentials stay in the platform connection. Tool traffic passes through Platform so calls can be authorized, audited, and counted without logging arguments or results.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mastra/connect
```

## Usage

Attach a connection to your Platform project using integration ID `resend` or `incident-io`. Configure the Platform project ID and access token, then pass the resolver to your agent's `tools` option:

```ts
import { connect } from '@mastra/connect';

const tools = connect({
  projectId: process.env.MASTRA_PROJECT_ID,
  client: { accessToken: process.env.MASTRA_PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN },
  integrations: {
    resend: { allowTools: ['resend_send_email', 'resend_get_email'] },
    'incident-io': { allowTools: ['incident_io_list_incidents', 'incident_io_list_follow_ups'] },
  },
});
```

The resolver discovers active project connections. Where multiple connections match, select one with `MASTRA_RESEND_CONNECTION_ID`, `MASTRA_INCIDENT_IO_CONNECTION_ID`, or the integration's `connectionId` option. The `integrations` entries configure individual providers; they do not disable other attached providers. Set `disabled: true` on providers you want to exclude.

| Provider    | Tool source          | Scope                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resend      | Generated HTTP tools | Emails and attachments, domains, templates, audiences, contacts, segments, topics, broadcasts, webhooks, and metrics                                      |
| incident.io | Generated HTTP tools | Incidents, updates, actions, follow-ups, timelines, alerts, on-call schedules, teams, users, postmortems, catalog reads, and incident configuration reads |

### MCP integrations

`connect()` also discovers any attached integration that advertises `capabilities.mcp: true` in the Platform catalog. No provider-specific registration or release of `@mastra/connect` is required. Discovered tools use the same flat dynamic-tool contract and are namespaced as `<integration-id>_<tool-name>`.

Every MCP provider uses `/v2/connections/:connectionId/mcp` for discovery and invocation. The adapter reuses each provider's MCP session across refreshes and closes sessions when the connection changes, is detached, or `disconnect()` is called. If an integration has both checked-in HTTP tools and an MCP capability, the MCP catalog is preferred.

The application sends only its Mastra Platform token. The transport is locked to the selected Platform connection URL. Platform removes caller authentication before Nango injects the provider credential and proxies each protocol request to the MCP server configured for that Nango integration.

MCP tool catalogs can change independently of this package. Use `allowTools` to give an agent the smallest useful subset. Every discovered MCP tool requires tool approval; the server's annotations are advisory and cannot lift the requirement. List the tool keys an agent may run unattended in `autoApproveTools` for that integration, for example `neon: { autoApproveTools: ['neon_list_projects'] }`. For multiple connections, the derived environment variable is `MASTRA_<INTEGRATION_ID>_CONNECTION_ID`, with punctuation converted to underscores.

### Generated HTTP providers

Resend and incident.io use checked-in tools generated from their provider contracts. Tool inputs preserve provider field names. Mutations put their JSON request payload under `body`. The one exception is `resend_create_contact_import`, whose `body` fields are sent as a multipart form upload with the CSV text in `body.file`.

```json
{
  "idempotency_key": "welcome-user-123",
  "body": {
    "from": "Team <team@example.com>",
    "to": ["reader@example.com"],
    "subject": "Welcome",
    "text": "Thanks for joining."
  }
}
```

Resend requires a verified sending domain and a key authorized for the operation. A sending-only key cannot list domains or access other account resources. Reuse the idempotency key when retrying the same send. Mastra's proxy runtime does not automatically retry POST requests.

List tools return one provider page and preserve its response envelope. When `next_cursor` is present, pass it as `after` for Resend and incident.io. Preserve filters and sort options between pages.

### Template provenance

Resend and incident.io are generated from integration-template contributions [#667](https://github.com/NangoHQ/integration-templates/pull/667) and [#668](https://github.com/NangoHQ/integration-templates/pull/668). Until they land upstream, each provider manifest pins the contributing repository and exact commit and records generated file checksums.

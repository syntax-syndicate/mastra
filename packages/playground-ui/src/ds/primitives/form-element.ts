// white on the off-white canvas, in dark it is the same step above it.
//
// Hover washes the fill, focus repaints the rim. Both go through `shadow-raised`:
// an `<input>` cannot carry a pseudo-element, so `--surface-tint` reaches into an
// inset layer of that utility and gives a field the same state layer a `Card` gets
// from `state-layer` — the rung a filter chip's segments already wear, which is the
// weight a resting field should move by. Brightening the rim on hover instead made
// every field in a form announce the pointer: the boundary is the loudest part of a
// surface that has no border of its own, so it is reserved for focus, where being
// unmissable is the point. Disabled is the exception that drops the card fill for
// the lowest translucent rung, which is how a disabled field reads as recessed.

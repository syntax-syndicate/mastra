/**
 * GitHub event rules this deployment overrides.
 *
 * A newly opened issue is routed by its labels, three ways:
 *
 * - `needs-triage` lands on Work › Intake and rests there until a person starts
 *   a run. A maintainer's explicit "needs attention" flag outranks any
 *   automated stamp, so the label wins even when `status: auto-triaged` is
 *   present too.
 * - `status: auto-triaged` — the label the triage skill applies when it
 *   finishes — is filed straight on Work › Planning, and nothing is started for
 *   it: the card is published to the board (a person may pick it up and run the
 *   planning phase), not launched. Triage already happened, so re-running it
 *   would be work done twice.
 * - neither label says who should look at it first, so it lands on Work ›
 *   Triage: that phase's entry rule runs the moment the card materializes,
 *   putting the triage agent on it and leaving the card ready to plan.
 *
 * The same rule answers for an issue whose card already exists — the reconcile
 * sweep replays it whenever the issue's live labels differ from the card's, so
 * a label gained or lost while Factory was not looking still lands the card
 * where the labels put it. A card that has already left Intake is re-placed by
 * relocation (no phase rule runs for it, per the `skipRules` contract) because
 * it is not arriving: it sits past the landing phase precisely because a
 * placement put it there. A card still resting on Intake is landed normally, so
 * Triage's entry rule runs and can start it.
 *
 * Issues placed by one of a project's own label routes keep the built-in
 * landing as well: the route owns the board and its initial phase.
 *
 * A pull request opening is answered for both cards it concerns. The arrival —
 * the evaluation the built-in handler files from, flagged `pullRequestIntake` —
 * is the pull request's own Review card; the item that authored the pull request
 * is answered separately, and is placed on Work › Review: the code is open for
 * review, so the item waits there instead of in the working phase that produced
 * it, where a reviewer's feedback can reach it. That placement is explicit, not
 * a governed transition — the item is not arriving on a board and nothing should
 * be started for it — so it runs no phase rules and leaves the card's metadata
 * alone, exactly like a label route change. Items on another board, terminal
 * items, and items a run owns stay where they are.

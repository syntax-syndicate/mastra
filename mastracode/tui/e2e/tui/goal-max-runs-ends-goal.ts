/**
 * Regression: once a goal has consumed its full run budget while still
 * `active` (the judge answered `waiting` on the final run, so the loop did not
 * pause it), every later chat turn hits the core goal step's budget guard. The
 * guard emitted a `goal` chunk with `status: 'active'` and `passed: false`
 * without invoking the judge or writing the record, which the TUI rendered as
 * `Goal ○ continue (N/N)` forever.
 *
 * Expected: reaching max runs ends the goal — no `continue` verdict is rendered
 * for the follow-up turn, `/goal status` reports it `paused` with the budget
 * reason, and the persisted objective is parked as `paused`.

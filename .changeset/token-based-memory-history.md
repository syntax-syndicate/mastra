Add a `messageHistory` memory option for token-budgeted conversation history. `messageHistory: { maxTokens, atMaxRemoveTokens? }` counts the complete prompt against the token budget and drops the oldest remembered messages in chunks. It never removes the current turn's input, responses, context, or system messages. During agent runs, a per-thread boundary is advanced and persisted so trimmed history stays out of subsequent turns without deleting stored messages.

When `messageHistory` is set without an explicit `lastMessages`, the default 10-message cap is dropped so the token budget alone defines the window. `lastMessages` remains supported and can be combined with `messageHistory`, but counting messages is a poor proxy for context size and `lastMessages` is now soft-deprecated in favour of `messageHistory`.

```ts
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory';

const memory = new Memory({
  options: {
    messageHistory: { maxTokens: 8_000, atMaxRemoveTokens: 2_000 },
  },
});
```

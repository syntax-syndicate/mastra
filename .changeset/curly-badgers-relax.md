Add SidebarNew overflow links that keep active and recently used routes visible for seven days. Add optional command header, search trigger, and footer metadata slots for product-specific composition. Escape now closes navigation takeover views and restores focus to the trigger. Mobile navigation uses a near-full-screen takeover with safe-area spacing and larger touch targets.

```tsx
<SidebarNew.CommandHeader>
  <SidebarNew.SearchTrigger aria-label="Search" onClick={openSearch} />
</SidebarNew.CommandHeader>
```

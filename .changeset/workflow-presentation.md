Redesign workflow cards with colored type badges, inset content surfaces, execution timing, and a shared activity edge. Conditions display their supplied expressions inline with copy support and unformatted-source fallbacks. Nested graphs expand inside dashed groups, while parallel paths retain a shared input-data control and distinct branch outputs.

Keep the canvas camera stable during execution and expansion. Position zoom controls above the graph with a 10–400% range, and anchor connectors to measured node bounds inside nested canvases.

`CollapsibleContent` accepts `fill` to stretch its content to the space the parent leaves, so a scroll area inside animates open to that height instead of snapping.

Workflow condition views no longer take disclosure or dialog state. Removed the unused `WorkflowConditionCode`, `WorkflowConditionDialog`, `WorkflowCardBadges`, and `WorkflowCardStatusIcon` exports; use `WorkflowConditionCard`, `WorkflowTypeBadge`, and the step card's status presentation instead.

Replace condition code/dialog composition with the inline card:

```tsx
import { WorkflowConditionCard } from '@mastra/playground-ui/components/Workflow';

<WorkflowConditionCard conditions={[{ type: 'when', fnString: '({ inputData }) => inputData.approved' }]} />;
```

Remove `hasStep` from `WorkflowStepCardView` props. Supply `nodeKind` when identifying a map, agent, tool, or timing node.

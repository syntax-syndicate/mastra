Added fallback model packs and pack-specific subscription routing. In `/models`, you can configure a fallback chain and choose the OAuth account each model in a pack uses. A selected account is used **exclusively** for that model: if it fails, the request moves to the pack's fallback chain instead of another account, so a heavy model cannot spend a second subscription's quota. `Automatic` keeps rotating through the provider's accounts in insertion order, starting from the account the pool is currently on, and a fallback pack applies its own routing. Pack hops remain visible in the transcript and persist when you reopen the thread.

Configure both from `/models` — select a pack, then:

```
/models
  → Set fallback…            # choose the pack to hop to when this pool is exhausted
  → Set subscription routing… # per model: pin one account, or Automatic
```

Custom packs can also define an observational memory model. When set, the OM observer and reflector resolve from the active pack and its fallback chain — so OM keeps working when a pack's provider is down. Packs without an OM model keep using your standalone OM configuration, and explicit `/om` overrides still win.

Both settings live in `settings.json` if you prefer to edit them directly:

```json
{
  "customModelPacks": [
    {
      "name": "Daily",
      "models": {
        "build": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6",
        "memory": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"
      }
    }
  ],
  "models": {
    "packFallbacks": { "custom:Daily": "anthropic" },
    "packAccountPreferences": {
      "custom:Daily": { "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6": "anthropic:a1b2c3d4" }
    }
  }
}
```

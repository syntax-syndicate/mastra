`ProviderHistoryCompat` now handles signed thinking blocks that cross providers. The new `anthropic-strip-foreign-signed-reasoning` rule drops signed reasoning from the outbound prompt when the turn that produced it was stamped with a different provider (for example Kimi For Coding ↔ `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`), since the receiving provider rejects a foreign signature with ``Invalid `signature` in `thinking` block``. To support provenance-aware rules, `processLLMRequest` args now expose the `messageList` the prompt was built from. Goal scorers created with `createGoalScorer` now include `ProviderHistoryCompat` in their input and error processor lanes by default, since goal judges talk to the same providers as the agent they judge.

```ts
import { ProviderHistoryCompat } from '@mastra/core/processors';

export const agent = new Agent({
  inputProcessors: [new ProviderHistoryCompat()],
  errorProcessors: [new ProviderHistoryCompat()],
});
```

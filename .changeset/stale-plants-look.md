Fixed PR syncing failing with a 401 when an expired GitHub token was exported in the environment. Each sync now resolves a fresh credential from the `gh` CLI and uses it when one is available, so a stale `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` is replaced instead of being sent to GitHub. Author permission and GitHub app owner lookups use the same credential.

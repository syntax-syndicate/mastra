   *   no moment at which any process can safely declare them finished, so
   *   nothing ever calls `clearTopic` on them. For these the TTL is the ONLY
   *   reclamation mechanism; with it disabled they accumulate for the
   *   lifetime of the Redis instance.
   *
   * Sizing: the TTL must exceed the longest window in which an idle stream is
   * still legitimately useful — chiefly, how long a grouped worker may be down
   * and still expect to replay its backlog on restart. If workers can be
   * offline longer than the TTL while publishers stay quiet, raise it.

/**
 * Policy knowledge base. Each document lives in its own file under
 * `src/mastra/knowledge/docs/` so it reads and edits like the standalone
 * Markdown file it represents.
 *
 * These are plain TS modules rather than `.md` files read from disk at
 * runtime on purpose: Mastra's bundler flattens `src/mastra` into
 * `.mastra/output`, so a directory a step reads with `fs` at runtime (e.g.
 * relative to `import.meta.url`) won't exist at the same relative path after
 * a build. Plain imports don't have that problem - the bundler resolves them
 * like any other module, in dev and in the built output alike.
 *
 * Add a new policy by creating a file in `docs/` and listing it here, then
 * re-run `POST /support/knowledge/reindex`.

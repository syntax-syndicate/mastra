/**
 * Wrapper (run as the exec command) that places the user command in its own
 * process group and records the group's PGID so kill() can signal the whole
 * group later.
 *
 * Docker's exec-inspect `Pid` is a host/daemon-namespace PID and cannot be used
 * with an in-container `kill`, so we need a container-namespace identity. We use
 * a *kernel-enforced* process group as that identity:
 *
 *   1. `setsid -w` re-execs the command as a new session/process-group leader,
 *      so its PID == PGID. Every descendant inherits that PGID (unless it calls
 *      `setsid` itself) and stays reachable even if it re-parents to PID 1.
 *      `-w` keeps the wrapper (and thus the exec) alive for the whole lifetime
 *      and propagates the child's exit status — without it `setsid` forks and
 *      returns immediately, so the exec would appear to finish while the real
 *      work keeps running.
 *   2. The leader writes its own PID (`$$`) — the PGID — to a private file that
 *      only this process wrote, so the identity is kernel-owned and cannot be
 *      forged by another container process.
 *
 * If `setsid -w` is unavailable in the image (e.g. BusyBox), we degrade
 * gracefully: the command runs directly and we record its PID so kill() can
 * still signal it (descendant coverage is then best-effort). The probe
 * `setsid -w true` also covers images without setsid at all.
 *
 * Positional args: $1 = pgid file path, $2 = user command. The script text is a
 * static constant; runtime values travel only as argv, never interpolated into
 * the command string.
